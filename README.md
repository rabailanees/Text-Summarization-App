**Text-Summarization-App: CI/CD for ML Model Deployment on Hugging Face Spaces**

This repository contains a **Text Summarization Application** with continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) setup using **GitHub Actions**. The project focuses on deploying a machine learning model for text summarization on **Hugging Face Spaces**.

### Features:
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automates the deployment process of the machine learning model.
- **Hugging Face Spaces Deployment**: Easily deploy the model on Hugging Face for fast inference.
- **Local Development**: Use your local environment to build, test, and prepare the model before pushing to the repository.

### How it Works:
1. **Model Development**: Develop and train a text summarization model locally.
2. **Push Code to GitHub**: Once the model is ready, push your code to the GitHub repository.
3. **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**: Upon each push, GitHub Actions automatically triggers the pipeline to test, build, and deploy the model to Hugging Face Spaces.
4. **Deployment to Hugging Face**: The model will be deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for easy access and usage.

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- GitHub account
- Hugging Face account

### Setup:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up your Hugging Face credentials.
3. Add your model to the appropriate directory.
4. Configure the GitHub Actions workflow for deployment.
